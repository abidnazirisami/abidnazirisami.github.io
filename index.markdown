<h1>Who am I?</h1>
 I am a fourth year PhD Student at [NC State](https://www.ncsu.edu/). I am working with [Dr. Marcelo D'Amorim](https://damorim.github.io/) as a member of the [Software Engineering Group](https://ncsu.software/). My areaf of research is Software Testing.

<h1>Research Interests</h1>

 My overall research interest lies in testing learning enabled system. I am working on various testing techniques to find bugs in Deep Learning Libraries such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, Jax etc. To date, I have reported 48 bugs in PyTorch and Tensorflow ([full list of reported bugs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r03ajIybbPeLBqHdxbD54Qghwoy8NjL2weeh89vX7wM/edit?usp=sharing)). I am also working in generating complex test cases for Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS).

<h1>Education and Experience</h1>

 I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Dhaka in 2018. After graduating, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Enosis Solutions](https://www.enosisbd.com/). I used to work with several desktop applications written primarily in `Delphi`, with other desktop applications and web apps involving technologies like `ASP.NET Core`, `React JS` etc.
