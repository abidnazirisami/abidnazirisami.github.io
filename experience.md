<h3> North Carolina State University </h3>

*Raleigh, NC, United States*

**Graduate Research Assistant**
*May 2023 - Present*

**Advisor:** [Dr. Marcelo D'Amorim](https://damorim.github.io/)

**Current Project**
I am currently working on generating complex test cases for Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Since testing ADS in real life is both costly and a safety concern, high-fidelity simulators that can create realistic scenarios are better for testing ADSs before deploying them to the real world. But due to the huge search space for testing these systems in these simulators, efficient ways of creating realistic and complex test cases is necessary to minimize the use of resources. My current work focuses on running an ADS agent on existing scenarios (test cases) and using simulation data to create a misbehavior predictor that specifies the risky portions of the scenarios. Then we clip the scenarios around these risky points to create smaller sub-simulations and apply different mutation operators on these sub-simulations to generate different children of these risky scenarios. This reduces the time required to generate these test cases and generates riskier test cases that can challenge the ever-evolving ADS agents.
